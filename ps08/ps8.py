        B_t(x, y, t) notes:
        - Use the function get_b_t to obtain the base binary image.
        - Notice that we are using two frames: I_t and I_{t-1} which represent the current and previous frames
          respectively.

          creating an array of all zeros.
        - It is recommended to try morphological operations such as erode or dilate to filter the base binary
          image before working on self.mhi (M_tau)

        - This array shows the motion progress using a range of values between 0 and tau.
        - When implementing the equation described in the problem set instructions you will notice that motion that
          happened recently shows as brighter areas.
