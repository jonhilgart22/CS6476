def hough_lines_acc(img_edges, rho_res, theta_res):
    """ Creates and returns a Hough accumulator array by computing the Hough Transform for lines on an
    edge image.

    This method defines the dimensions of the output Hough array using the rho and theta resolution
    parameters. The Hough accumulator is a 2-D array where its rows and columns represent the index
    values of the vectors rho and theta respectively. The length of each dimension is set by the
    resolution parameters. For example: if rho is a vector of values that are in [a_0, a_1, a_2, ... a_n],
    and rho_res = 1, rho should remain as [a_0, a_1, a_2, ... , a_n]. If rho_res = 2, then rho would
    be half its length i.e [a_0, a_2, a_4, ... , a_n] (assuming n is even). The same description applies
    to theta_res and the output vector theta. These two parameters define the size of each bin in
    the Hough array.

    Note that indexing using negative numbers will result in calling index values starting from
    the end. For example, if b = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] calling b[-2] will return 3.

    Args:
        img_edges (numpy.array): edge image (every nonzero value is considered an edge).
        rho_res (int): rho resolution (in pixels).
        theta_res (float): theta resolution (in degrees converted to radians i.e 1 deg = pi/180).

    Returns:
        tuple: Three-element tuple containing:
               H (numpy.array): Hough accumulator array.
               rho (numpy.array): vector of rho values, one for each row of H
               theta (numpy.array): vector of theta values, one for each column of H.

    This function selects the pixels with the highest intensity values in an area and returns an array
    with the row and column indices that correspond to a local maxima. This search will only look at pixel
    values that are greater than or equal to hough_threshold.

    Part of this function performs a non-maxima suppression using the parameter nhood_delta which will
    indicate the area that a local maxima covers. This means that any other pixels, with a non-zero values,
    that are inside this area will not be counted as a peak eliminating possible duplicates. The
    neighborhood is a rectangular area of shape nhood_delta[0] * 2 by nhood_delta[1] * 2.

    When working with hough lines, you may need to use the true value of the rows and columns to suppress
    duplicate values due to aliasing. You can use the rows and cols parameters to access the true value of
    for rho and theta at a specific peak.

    Args:
        H (numpy.array): Hough accumulator array.

    In this method you will call both hough_circles_acc and hough_peaks.

    The goal here is to call hough_circles_acc iterating over the values in 'radii'. A Hough accumulator
    is generated for each radius value and the respective peaks are identified. It is recommended that
    the peaks from all radii are stored with their respective vote value. That way you can identify which
    are true peaks and discard false positives.
